#### Abstract

A recipe from my childhood with fragrant rice and bubbly, sweet juice. This is my take on the Vietnamese way of preparing and having this dessert.

Heavily inspired by [Sonia's](http://nasilemaklover.blogspot.com/2015/11/homemade-yellow-glutinous-rice-wine.html) recipe.

#### Materials

- Pan with steamer
- Metal steaming bowl
- 2 Sterilized clear glass jars
- Sterilized (metal) spoon(s)
- Mortar and Pestle or Food Processor

#### Reagents

||Ingredient|Amount|Preparation|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|<input type="checkbox">|Sweet glutinous rice|1 cup|None|
|<input type="checkbox">|Water|1 and 1/2 cup|Filtered (preferred)|
|<input type="checkbox">|Chinese distiller's yeast balls|4 Tbsp (40g)|None|
|<input type="checkbox">|Optional: Granulated Sugar|2 Tbsp|None|

<br/>

#### Procedure

1. Wash and rinse glutinous rice with cold water in the metal steaming bowl.
2. Soak rice with 1/2" of (distilled) water for 1 hour.
3. While waiting, prepare the yeast balls by grinding into fine powder. Seal in a dry, sterile jar.
4. Prepare the steaming basket over the pan and boil water on medium heat.
5. Once steaming basket is boiling set heat to medium-low and place soaked rice in the steaming basking. Steam for 30-40 mins, mixing rice with a clean spoon halfway through.
6. Removed steamed rice from the steamer basket and allow to cool completely at room temperature, approximately 1 hour.
7. Wash hands with soap thoroughly.
8. Form flat discs with the glutinous rice. Using a sterile spoon, lightly dust the rice with powdered yeast. Flip the rice disc and dust with powdered yeast.
9. Add the yeast-covered disc to sterilized jar.
10. (Optional) For a stronger wine, lightly dust the rice with granulated sugar.
11. Repeat with the remaining rice.
12. Lightly seal jar and place in a warm, dark area.

Fermenting
1.  The distiller's yeast has an optimal operating temperature of 28<sup>o</sup>C. I created a warm space by putting a bowl of hot water in the oven and replaced the water twice a day. Any warm, dark space will work.
2.  Let the rice ferment for 48-72 hours depending on ambient temperature and wine flavor.
    1.  A translucent liquid will pool in the jar and bubbles will rise to the top. This indicates that the rice is actively fermenting.
    2.  Sterilize a spoon and taste the wine. Place the jar in the fridge when the flavor is sweet and no longer like yeast.

Serving
1.  Using a sterilized spoon, scoop rice and some liquid into your serving bowl.
2.  The rice wine may be enjoyed as is or topped with
