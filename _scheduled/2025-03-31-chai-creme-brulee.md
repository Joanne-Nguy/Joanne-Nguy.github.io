#### Procedure

Optional: Cream Cold Infusion
1. Add tea, ginger and cardamom, if using, to a tea bag and tie tightly.
2. Add tea bag and vanilla to heavy cream carton and allow to infuse in the fridge for 4-24 hours.

Prepare Custard
3. If using cold infused cream, add infused cream and salt to saucepan. Optionally remove bag containing spices. If using fresh cream, add spices and salt.
4. Cook over low heat until hot and runny. Let cool for 5 mins.
5. In a large bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light.
6. Slowly stream 1/4 of the cream into the large bowl while mixing.
7. Add the tempered egg mixture into the saucepot and mix.

Prepare Ramekins
8. Place ramekins into a casserole dish or big pot. Fill dish or pot with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
9. Pour creme mixture over a strainer into each ramekin evenly. Discard strainer contents
10. Gently tap the pot to allow bubbles to surface. Use the butane torch to quickly pop bubbles.
    
Bake Custard
11. Pre-heat over to 325<sup>o</sup>C. Bake for 30-40 mins or until center slightly jiggles when tapped.
- If center wobbles when tapped, creme is undercooked. Bake for additional time.
12. Cool at room temperature for 30-60 mins.
13. Cover and refrigerate for 4-48 hours.
    
Serve Creme Brulee
14. Add a thin layer of sugar to the top of each ramekin.
15. If using a butane torch, melt the sugar in small areas, moving the torch slowly and allowing the sugar to bubble and crystallize before moving to the next area.
16. If a butane torch is unavailable, broil the top of the ramekin for 5 mins.
17. Serve within 30 mins before sugar layer becomes soft.

Patience is another key ingredient in this recipe. If the custard does not have adequate time to bake or set, the center will be liquidy rather than the desired thick, creamy custard. If the process is not rushed, the reward is well earned, boasting a satisfying melted sugar crust and a gingery spiced custard.

##### Variations

Cold infusion allows for delicate flavors to be added to the cream before preparing the custard. For other chai flavor profiles, experiment with adding spices like cinnamon sticks or cloves and herbs like mint or basil.

For other flavor profiles, other herbs and fruits can be added to the cream either in cold infusion or hot infusion. Feel free to use any spare ingredients lying around your fridge or garden.

##### Techniques

Tempering Egg Yolks

Warm cream is added to the egg yolks to slowly increase the temperature of the egg yolks. When temperature is added too quickly, the egg yolks cook and curdle. Cooked bits are strained out in case any clumps form.

[Bain Marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie#:~:text=Baked%20custard%20desserts%20such%20as%20custard%20tarts,custard%20before%20the%20interior%20is%20fully%20cooked.&text=Bains%2Dmarie%20can%20be%20used%20in%20place%20of,hot%20plates%20are%20inconvenient%20or%20too%20powerful.)

The ramekins are placed in a pot with boiling water to allow the custard to heat slowly and increase the humidity in the oven. As with tempering the egg yolks in the previous step, slowly heating the custard prevents the egg yolks from further curdling in the oven. The thick ceramic material of the ramekins and the boiling water bain marie both contribute to cooking the custard evenly. The increased humidity from the boiling water allows the custard to cook without forming cracks on the surface.
