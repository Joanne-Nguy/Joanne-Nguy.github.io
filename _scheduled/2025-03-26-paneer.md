#### Abstract

A recipe of the simple firm Indian cheese using readily-available ingredients. This recipe is based on the North Indian [method of preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer).

Heavily inspired by [Nagi's](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-make-paneer-fresh-indian-cheese/) recipe with supplemental info from [Khan and Pal's review article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3551056/pdf/13197_2011_Article_247.pdf).

#### Materials

- Large pot
- (Optional) Food thermometer
- Ladle
- Colander or hoop strainer
- Large bowl
- Plate with tall rim
- 2 Cheesecloths
- Flat heavy weight (~400g)
- Clean storage container

#### Reagents

||Ingredient|Amount|Preparation|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|<input type="checkbox">|Whole cow's milk|2 litre|None|
|<input type="checkbox">|White vinegar or lemon juice|4 Tbsp|None|

#### Procedure

Milk Curdling
1. Pour milk into a large pot on high-heat.
2. Add salt and chili flakes if using.
3. Watch the milk and wait for either temperature to reach 85<sup>o</sup>C or until milk starts to foam but not boil.
4. Turn off the heat and add the acid (white vinegar or lemon juice). 
5. Swirl the liquid gently with a spoon. Curds will begin to separate from the milk within 1 min.
   1. If the milk does not curdle, the temperature may not have reached high enough. Heat the pot again until near boiling and try steps 4-5 again.

Whey Straining
6. Place the colander/strainer over a large bowl and line the colander/strainer with 2 cheese cloths.
7. Ladle half the curds and whey into the cheesecloth-lined colander/strainer. Pour the rest in.
8. Allow whey to strain for 5-10 mins.
9. Remove bowl with whey and set aside.
   1.  Store excess whey in a clean jar and use for other recipes.
10. Rinse curds with water to remove any remaining flavor from the acid. Bundle the curds in the cheesecloth and gently squeeze out excess water.

Cheese Pressing
11. Place the colander on a plate with a tall rim. Shape the cheese into a disc shape and place it in the colander.
12. Place the weight on top of the cheese.
13. Refrigerate for 3-4 hours.
14. Take the cheese out of the fridge and upwrap it. Use as is for your dish or store for later use.

Paneer is a versatile vegetarian meat substitute used in many delicious Indian dishes such as palak paneer or paneer tikka. It has a sweet cheesy aroma that's hard to resist and absorbs the flavors of the dish it's cooked in very well. I found the homemade paneer recipe produced a light and airy cheese lacking the characteristic cheese squeak when bitten into, in contrast with store-bought paneer which is dense and filling. This is because the recipe above is North Indian style, while the ones found in stores are usually prepared the [Bengali way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer).

##### Cost Comparison

My first attempt at this dish surprised me at how easy it was to make at home! The ingredients are accessible and economical if your local Indian grocery store is out of the way.

|Ingredient|Store amount|Store price (USD)|Amount per recipe|Price per recipe (USD)|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|[Whole Milk](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Milk-Whole-Vitamin-D-Half-Gallon-Plastic-Jug/)|1890 mL|2.12|2000 mL|2.24|
|[White Vinegar](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Distilled-White-Vinegar-64-fl-oz/)|1890 mL|2.97|59 mL|0.093|
|[Salt](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Morton-Sea-Salt-Fine-4-4-Ounce/)|125 g|1.33|10 g|0.106|
||||||
|[Store-bought Paneer](https://spiceboxgrocery.com/products/gopi-paneer)|1130 g|18.99|350 g|5.88|

From the cost analysis above, we can see that when buying paneer from the store in the bulk size and adjusted for our recipe yield amount will cost $5.88. The cost of homemade paneer is '$$2.24 + 0.093 + 0.106 = $2.439$$', which is a cost savings of '$$1 - 2.439 / 5.88 = 59%$$' from store bought. (But by girl math theorems, if you use ingredients already in your pantry the cost is free, right?) At the end of the day, it is up to you to decide whether the process and resulting fresh paneer is worth more than buying it outright, but you found yourself here already, dear reader.

##### Additions

This recipe adds chili flakes for a bit of heat when eaten. Other addition ideas are any combination of herbs and spices from this list: coriander leaves, dried fenugreek leaves (methi), cumin seeds, ginger, garlic powder, tumeric, chili powder, ground peppercorns. Depending on how delicate the ingredient is, aim to add it as close to the coagulation step as possible to avoid over heating of the ingredient. There are so many different flavor combinations to try with so many different curries or even fried by itself.

##### Whey

The composition of [whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey) is the remainder of the milk proteins and lactose that did not curdle with the addition of your acid. In our case, the by-product of paneer is sweet whey, which can be a great addition to other dishes. From a nutrition standpoint, it adds a negligible amount of protein ([0.8%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey#Composition)), but it does add a bit of depth to your dishes with its sweet and tangy profile. 

Whey can be used as a milk replacement in many recipes such as smoothies, protein shakes, or my favorite, overnight oats. The flavor is reminiscent of cheese but the texture is closer to that of water. This allows whey to also be used as a water replacement in savory recipes like soups or breads. The whey can also be furtehr processed to produce ricotta, a whey cheese.
