#### Procedure

1. In a heat-proof bowl, add brown sugar and granulated sugar.
2. (Optional) Place the heat-proof bowl in an ice bath.
3. Brown the butter:</br>
   1. Heat a light-colored pan to medium heat on the stove.
   2. Cut softened butter into small, equally-sized cubes.
   3. Once pan has heated up, add butter.
   4. Continuously stir with silicone spatula until cubes have melted.
   5. Listen for when the crackling subsides and foam starts to clear - milk solids (brown bits) will start collecting on the bottom of the pan.
   6. Lower heat.
   7. Add milk powder and toast for 10s-20s until golden.
4. Immediately take off heat and pour browned butter including milk solids into heat-proof bowl with sugar.
5. Chill bowl in ice bath or fridge for 15-20mins until solid but still soft to touch.
6. While waiting, sift flour, baking soda and salt into a mixing bowl. Set aside.
7. Whisk brown butter and sugar on medium until combined ~1 mins.
8. Add vanilla and eggs.
9. Whisk wet ingredients on high until fluffy ~2 mins.
10. Whisk on low. Add half of dry ingredients until combined. Add the rest of the dry ingredients until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
11. Add chocolate chips and toffee bits, if using. Mix with spatula until combined, ensuring bottom is well-mixed.
12. Cover mixing bowl and place in the fridge for 1-2 hours.
13. Scoop cookies and place into a freezer bag. Let the dough rest for 24-48 hours.
14. Bake at 350<sup>o</sup> for 12-14 mins until edges are golden brown.
    1.  Time will depend on factors such as cookie scoop size and texture preference. Try 13 mins first, then adjust from there.
15. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10-15 mins before moving to wire rack. Add flaky sea salt.
16. Cookies stay fresh for 3 days on the counter or 1 week in the fridge.
    1.  Microwave for ~7s before enjoying.
17. Extra dough can be stored in the freezer for up to 6 months. When baking, use 350<sup>o</sup> and add a minute to the bake time.
