#### Procedure

Optional: Cream Cold Infusion
1. Add lavender and vanilla to heavy cream carton and allow to infuse in the fridge for 4-24 hours.

Prepare Lemon Juice
1. Take softened lemons and make 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest using microplane. Set zest aside.
2. Halve the zested lemons from top to bottom and scoop flesh into a bowl.
3. Optionally blench lemon and strain. Or, squeeze lemon flesh over a strainer. Collect 1/3 cup of lemon juice. Set aside.
4. Keep lemon peel halves to use as bowls. 
- The bottoms can be sliced with a knife so lemon halves can sit flat against a surface.

Prepare Pudding
5. Add sugar and lemon zest into a large bowl. Using your hands, rub the lemon zest and sugar together to extract the citron oils from the peel.
6. If using cold infused cream, add infused cream, sugar-zest mixture and salt to saucepan. If using fresh cream, add lavender and salt.
7. Cook over medium heat until simmering. Cook for 15-20 mins or until thickened.
8. Remove the mixture from heat.
9. Stir in prepared lemon juice and vanilla extract.
10.  Let the pudding sit for 20 mins.
11.  Pour the pudding through a strainer into lemon halves or ramekins evenly.
12.  Refrigerate covered for at least 3 hours.

Serve Lemon Posset
13. Add a thin layer of sugar to the top of each lemon half or ramekin.
14. Using a butane torch, melt the sugar in small areas, moving the torch slowly and allowing the sugar to bubble and crystallize before moving to the next area.
15. Garnish with lavender sprigs and serve within 30 mins before sugar layer becomes soft.

A simple recipe that tastes of spring - the perfect refreshing dessert with notes of lemon, lavender and carmelized sugar. Pouring the pudding into lemon cups adds to the playful, sunny aesthetic and garnishing with a lavender sprig allows tasters to be able to connect the floral notes to the herb it comes from. Cracking the sugar layer is reminiscent of plants sprouting from soil warmed by the spring sun.

##### Variations

Lemon posset is a simple dessert that can be enjoyed a variety of ways with the addition of other spring themed ingredients such as rose petals or berries. I have lavender readily available in my garden and prefer french lavender over spanish lavender as it is less sour and milder in flavor. Feel free to use ingredients that are readily available to you to enhance this delicious dessert.

Garnishes can enhance the visual appeal and texture of lemon posset. Some examples to use are leafy herbs like mint, nuts like almond slices, fruit jams, candied citrus peels. The possibilities are endless with this dessert!

Other citrus fruits such as oranges, tangerines or pomelo can be used in place of lemons. The acidity of citrus fruits allows the cream to curdle and set into a pudding consistency. Additional citric acid may be added to aid setting.
