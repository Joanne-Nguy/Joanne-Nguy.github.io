Hello! 

I'm a molecular biologist by training after graduating with a Bachelors of Science from the University of Toronto in 2019. My passion is in learning more about my field and process development.

In my spare time, I love [baking](https://joanne-nguy.github.io/blog/) creative recipes (especially cookies!) and walks by the oceanðŸŒŠ.
