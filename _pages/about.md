I have a background in molecular biology and assay development. I specialize in process optimization and data analysis, ensuring high-quality and reproducible results in biotech research.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked closely with R&D teams to develop robust assays, troubleshoot technical challenges, and streamline workflows. Iâ€™m passionate about innovation and continuously improving laboratory processes to drive impactful results.

In my spare time, I love baking creative [recipes](https://joanne-nguy.github.io/blog/tags/baking) (especially cookies!) and walks by the oceanðŸŒŠ.
