I'm a molecular biologist by training after graduating with a Bachelors of Science from the University of Toronto in 2019. My passion is in process development and optimization both in the lab and through scripting.

In my spare time, I love baking creative [recipes](https://joanne-nguy.github.io/blog/) (especially cookies!) and walks by the oceanðŸŒŠ.
